Witten-Bell smoothing proved quite tricky to implement and to fully understand. But it was quite gratifying once

In this lad you also started to appreciate the importance of having good and complete data-sets for training, 
since unseen data can be such a problem.


Lab3: Nice introduction to feature-engineering.
